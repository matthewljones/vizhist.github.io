# history of visualization / visualization in history
## April 8, 2017

## workshop

This workshop brings together historians, sociologists and anthropologists studying practices of data visualization with historians and social scientists using many of those practices in the pursuit of history. The goal is a more reflective critical practice of visualizations within the social sciences and a less anachronistic technical history of data visualization practices, by bringing together the methodological sophistication of science and technology studies, digitial humanities, and media theory.
